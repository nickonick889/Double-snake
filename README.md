As players I want to see the selection of diffuclty to play

Level 1: Easy Mode
As a player, I want to wrap around the screen edges so that I never die from hitting a wall.

As a player, I am able to touch my own snake without worrying about collisions.

As a player, I am able to touch the other player snake without worrying about collisions.

Level 2: Medium Mode
As a player, I want the game to end if I hit a wall to increase the challenge.

As a player, I want the game to end if I touch the other player snake.

As a player, I want to lose body segments if I collide with myself so that there is a penalty for poor maneuvering without an immediate Game Over.

Level 3: Hard Mode
As a player, I want any collision (wall, self, or opponent) to result in an instant loss to test my precision and reflexes.

The game will end and declare the winner by stating who score the higher points!
