# Double-snake
General Assembly Unit 1 Project 1


## Description
Snake is a famous game but usually it is just about controlling one snake, hence it is a good challenge to see if you can control two snakes at once

## How To Play
For the first snake, control it with WASD.

For the second snake, control it with Arrow Keys.

Any collision (wall, self, or between the snakes) will result in an instant loss to test your precision and reflexes.

The game will end and show the current game score and the best score you had before, the challenge is to see who can score the higher points!
